   <p>Teli ka Mandir, also known as Telika Temple, is a Hindu temple located within the Gwalior Fort in Madhya Pradesh, India. Dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu and Matrikas, it has been variously dated between the early 8th and early 9th century CE.[1][2]</p> 
   <p>It is an atypical design for a Hindu temple,[1] as it has a rectangular sanctum instead of the typical square. It integrates the architectural elements of the Nagara style and the Valabhi prasada. The temple is based on a Gurjara Pratihara-Gopagiri style North Indian architecture.[3][4][5]</p>
   <p><b>History</b></p>
   <p>The Telika Mandir is generally dated to between 8th and 9th century based on paleography, art-style, architectural design and small inscriptions found within the temple premises.[1][2] According to Michael Meister, an art historian and a professor specializing in Indian temple architecture, the temple was built by 750 CE, per the most recently discovered inscriptions in Gwalior.[3][15] George Michell, another art historian and a professor specializing in Indian temples, the temple was complete by the 9th century.[1] Bharne and Krusche place the temple between 700 and 750 CE,[5] while Allen places it in the 8th century.[2] According to Allen, some local literature states it to be from the 11th century, but the evidence suggests that this late chronology is inaccurate.[2] According to Bajpai, the temple may have been built during the reign of the Gurjara-Pratihara Mihira Bhoja.[16]</p>
