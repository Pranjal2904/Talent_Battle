    <p>The Tombs of Mohammed Ghaus & Tansen are located in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, around 1 km from Gwalior Fort and 3 km from Gwalior Junction. The tomb complex, which is well-known for its architecture, is one of Gwalior's most popular tourist destinations</p>
    <p>During the reign of Akbar, the tomb of Mohammad Ghaus was constructed in the 16th century AD. Ghaus Mohammed was an Afghan prince who became a Sufi saint later in life. According to mythology, when Babur took the fort of Gwalior in 1526 CE, Mohammad Ghaus aided him. The 16th-century Sufi saint holds a significant place in Mughal India's history, and is thought to have had significant influence over Mughal kings such as Babur and Humayun.

        Ghaus Mohammed's Tomb is a popular pilgrimage site for Muslims and Hindus alike. This tomb's structure is classic Mughal, with hexagonal pillars standing at each of its four corners. The structure is square in plan, with a square dome capped with blue ceramic tiles. It contains hexagonal domed kiosks at each corner, as well as sloping eaves that protrude from the outside. Intricate sculptures and latticework adorn the tomb walls.</p>
