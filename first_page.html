    <u><h2>RECESSION:</h2></u>
   <a href="another_page.html" target="_blank"> <p>A recession is when the GDP growth rate of a country is negative for two consecutive quarters or more. But a recession can be gauged even before the quarterly gross domestic product reports are out based on key economic indicators like manufacturing data, decline in incomes, employment levels etc.,</p>
    <p>Although an economy can show signs of weakening months before a recession begins, the process of determining whether a country is in a true recession (or not) often takes time. A recession is short, but its impact can be long-lasting.
