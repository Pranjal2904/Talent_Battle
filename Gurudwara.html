    <p>Gurdwara Shri Data Bandi Chhor Sahib is located in Gwalior, the Gurdwara is associated with the imprisonment of Shri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji in Gwalior Fort and his famous release. Guru Hargobind achieved the freedom of 52 rajas (kings) who were imprisoned in the fort for a long time. The word 'Bandi' means 'imprisonment', 'Chhor' means 'liberation'.</p>
    <p>The death of Sri Guru Arjan Sahib at the hands of Mughal Emperor Jahangir prompted Guru Hargobind to emphasize the military dimension of the Sikh community. Guru Hargobind symbolically wore two swords, representing miri and piri (temporary power and spiritual authority). Guru Hargobind also built a fort to protect Ramdaspur (Amritsar) and built a ceremonial court, the Sri Akal Takht.</p>
